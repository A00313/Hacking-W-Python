Hacking Tools Built using Python
(This is for educational purposes only)
These are real tools that work on real networks if used correctly.
Welcome to the repository showcasing various hacking tools developed in Python. Each tool serves as an educational resource to understand cybersecurity concepts and network vulnerabilities. Here's a brief description of each tool:

ARP_spoof: Allows for ARP spoofing, a technique used to intercept data between network devices.

Update ARP Spoof: A refined version of ARP spoofing tool with updates for enhanced functionality and reliability.

Code_Injector: Enables injecting custom code into network packets, demonstrating packet manipulation techniques.

IP_Scanner: Provides functionality for scanning IP addresses on a network, aiding in network reconnaissance.

Mac_changer: Allows for changing the MAC address of a network interface, useful for anonymizing network traffic.

Packet_sniffer: Facilitates sniffing and analyzing network packets, aiding in network traffic analysis.

Replace_Downloads: Demonstrates replacing downloaded files on a network, highlighting potential security risks.

V2_Code_Injector: Enhanced version of Code_Injector with additional features and improvements.

dns_spoof.py: Enables DNS spoofing, a technique to redirect DNS queries to malicious servers for interception.

net_cut: Utility for cutting off internet connectivity for devices on a network, illustrating denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

Feel free to explore each tool and use them responsibly for educational purposes only. Remember to adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations when experimenting with cybersecurity concepts.
